## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Boozebot was developed to demonstrate the capabilities of the Curtin Robotics Club as a robotics Developement team. We had a couple goals in mind when developing Boozebot version 3. These where:
 - serve legal drinks(do not exceed the alcohol limit)
 - mix complicated Drinks
 - mix drinks in a quick fashion either equivalent to or faster than an average bartender.
 - have a mixture of high volume and high accuracy flow rates.
 - have a simplified backend and user interface for Boozebot.

The finale Boozebot 3 design has 4 major physical elements and 4 software elements. These consist of:
 Hardware:
 - The high Volume Liquids
 - The high Accuracy mixers
 - The Control Unit
 - The Cup Gantry and liquid spouts
 Software:
 - HTML User Interface
 - The Menu writing and reading system
 - The drink Calculations
 - The Control Unit backend

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
